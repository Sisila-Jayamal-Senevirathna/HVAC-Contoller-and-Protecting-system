Cooling a home using a conventional air conditioning system is not very efficient. The main objective of the project is to measure the indoor and outdoor temperature and control the AC through an energy-efficient temperature and start a ventilation system if required. This embedded system is controlled using an ATmega-328P microcontroller.
