Cooling a home using a conventional air conditioning system is not very efficient. The main objective of the project is to measure the indoor and outdoor temperature and control the AC through an energy-efficient temperature and start a ventilation system if required. This embedded system is controlled using an ATmega-328P microcontroller and programmed using C programming language.

## Problem statement
Air Conditioners are depending on the ambient air to remove heat. When the outside temperature is high, the air conditioner can't remove heat effectively. Thus, the air conditioner may struggle to provide sufficient and energy efficient cooling. If the outside temperature is below the air conditioning limit, we may experience the following consequences. The unit's inner coils will freeze.The lubricating fluid will thicken, and the unit will not function properly and may ultimately damage the air conditioner.
